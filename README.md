# ESP8266-MQTT-RF
Controlling RF devices with an [ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) &amp; a RF transmitter over [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) and using [Apple HomeKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeKit) with [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/) to use the Home app and Siri.

Google's Android and Amazon's Alexa can also be used.

This project's primary goal is to use an ESP8266 with an RF transmitter for cost-effective upgrading to control existing standard RF controllable blinds.
For this purpose, Somfy blinds were used to control over a command prompt and Apple's HomeKit via MQTT and the ESP8266 board.
